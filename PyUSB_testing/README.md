# Flashing folder for RC2

This script was primarily developed by Kevin Nottberg and he deserves credit for the functionality of these scripts

All commands using the following files will be executed within the terminal, while the RC2 device is plugged into the host computer. For more details on how to correctly use the files in this folder see our senior project report. Following the guides in apendix sections

All .sli files are image files used for flashing an RC2, they may or may not work depending on which RC2 is being attempted to flash.
