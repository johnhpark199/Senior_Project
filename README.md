Used to automate testing of LoRa and WiFi modules. 

When the WiFi script is running it will automatically take a WiFi RSSI reading using the network_terminal.c program. This reading must be manually recorded by the user.

LoRa script automatically harvests and collects any incoming LoRa packets. This script will also autorecord the readings from those packets and write them to an excel file.
