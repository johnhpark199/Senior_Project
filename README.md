# RC2 Testing files (.ipynb and .py)

Used to automate testing of LoRa and WiFi modules. 

When the WiFi script is running it will automatically take a WiFi RSSI reading using the network_terminal.c program. This reading must be manually recorded by the user.

LoRa script automatically harvests and collects any incoming LoRa packets. This script will also autorecord the readings from those packets and write them to an excel file.

# PyUSB_Testing

This folder is dedicated to the files used for the flashing of the RC2, following the guide listed on our senior project report at XXX. These files can be leveraged for correct operation of the RC2.
